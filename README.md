# alien-invasion
## A very simple alien invasion game, and soon-to-be Framework (GameCore) for Pygame.

This was originally based on the tutorial in
"Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project Based Introduction to Programming",
however I have deviated far from that example.
This project is now the foundation of both my Python learning quest,
and my Pygame framework that should simplify the creation of 2D games in Python.
